### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because I enjoy blackjack as a game and it was really interesting figuring it out through coding. I also liked delving deeper into the rules more than I normally would to try and find out every single thing about the game. This has inspired me to try and code other games and solve mysteries about how they work.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because It really showed how much I could accomplish even with simple code. It was really fun to see how I could manipulate the loops to change the image. Playing around with it I could see so much more is possible and I want to achieve those strides.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because it was a very fun introduction to learning functions. Going through the motions of writing out what a function does and then calling it felt great. This lab made me much more immersed as a coder and made me want to immediately learn more.
